    content: "Digital marketing enthusiasts are talking a lot these days about\nstartups.\_In this article, you will learn about the concept of startup and\nits examples.\n\nStartup is a company that is in the first stage of its\noperations.\_These companies are often initially supported by their\nentrepreneurial founders and used to develop a product or service because their\nfounders believe there is a demand for it.\_Due to limited revenue or high\ncosts, most of these small-scale operations are not sustainable in the long run\nand will not last without the help of investors.\n\nIn the late 1990s, the most common type of startup was\ndotcom.\_Investing at this time was very easy due to the interest of\ninvestors in the emergence of this type of business.\_Simply put, a startup\nis a technology-based business.\_Not every technology-based business is\nnecessarily a startup, but all startups use the [web, mobile, Internet website traffic](https://groups.google.com/g/targeted-visitors/c/4Jd01Dkk3Io), and new technologies to grow and reach a large\nnumber of users.\n\n# What is a startup?\n\nDefinition of Startup: Although the framework of the concept\nof startup is almost fixed, but for this concept, definitions are provided,\nsome examples of which we will examine:\n\n## [**Definition of Startup by the US Small Business Center (USSBA)**](https://groups.google.com/g/targeted-visitors/c/8HvJwXSKQHA)**:**\n\nA business that is generally centered around technology and\nhas high growth potential.\n\n## Definition of Startup by Steve Blank:\n\nAn organization formed in search of a business model that is\nreproducible and scalable.\n\n## Definition of Startup by Eric Reese:\n\nA startup is a human entity that has been created to present\na new product or service in a situation of high ambiguity.\_This definition\nis given in Eric Reese's book Pure Toddler.\n\n## Definition of startup as an English word in Webster Dictionary:\n\nOperation Set up and launch an operation or move\n\n## What is the difference between a startup and a\_small business?\n\nAt first, many of us may think of startups as equivalent to\nsmall businesses.\_Although startups and small businesses are similar in\nmany ways, there are differences.\n\n## Types of startups\n\nSubblock, author of the Economy website, introduces 5 types\nof successful startups as follows: (Types of startups)\n\nIt is a startup that is integrated into our daily\nlives.\_For example, a person who has provided an electric car for fun in\nthe park, by offering it to others and receiving money, can keep his electric\ncar at a high level and have more fun\n\nIn this type of startup, it is usually owned and operated by\na family, and they do more to support the family.\n\nThese types of profits are more productive and generally\nform a group of innovative and creative clusters.\_So that a few good ideas\ntogether form a purer idea.\n\nTypes of startups include lifestyle, small businesses,\nscalable, for sale, social and large businesses\n\nFor example, in the field of housing, start-ups are provided\nthat can solve the problem of real estate companies quickly.\_The creator\nof this startup only aims to sell this startup to large companies.\n\nThe goal of these startups is not just to make money, and\ntheir focus is more on turning the world into a better place for humans.\n\nLarge companies are forced to compete with new programs and\nstartups due to changes in customer tastes, new technologies, legislation, new\ncompetitors, and so on.\n\nUnlike scalable startups, the goal of these startups is to\nmake the world a better place, not to gain market share or build wealth for its\nfounders.\_After stating the types of startups to better understand the\nconcept. Startup, you need to\_get acquainted\_with startup\_weekend.\n\n### Startup Weekend\n\nStartup Weekend is a 54-hour weekend event where people from\ndifferent groups (developers, business executives, etc.) come up with\nideas.\_In fact, Startup Weekend is a place to present ideas.\_Judges\nand investment companies decide to accept or reject ideas by looking at\ndifferent ideas.\_\n\nThe first startup weekend history, which is also the first\nstartup history in its current form, dates back to 2007 in Boulder, Colorado,\nUSA.\_70 investors were present at that event.\n\nIn the continuation of this article, a brief history of\nentrepreneurship in Iran and the world is given in order to answer questions\nsuch as [how to\nbuild a startup](https://sites.google.com/view/php-4-beginners/home).\n\n#### History of Entrepreneurship\n\nFirst, we need to describe a concept called production\nscale.\n\nDefine production scale\n\nThe scale of production actually represents the output of a\nunit - usually industrial.\_Units that have a high output rate know their\nvolume of production with a high scale of production. How to produce falls into\nthe following four categories, which will be briefly described:\n\nBeginning in the 18th century, entrepreneurs moved from\nsmall-scale production in small towns to mass production.\_The availability\nof energy and manpower led to this move.\_The growing demand for products\nrequired proper organization and on the other hand provided the space for\nbusinesses to start.\_The United States played a prominent role during this\nperiod, and entrepreneurs such as Andrew Carnegie, George Morgan, and John\nDee.\_Rockefeller, Frank Kennan and Henry Ford.\n\nThere are other startups that operate in different\nfields.\_They can be seen below:\n\nAccording to the above list, the startups needed in Iran can\nbe identified and created with a correct idea generation.\n\n#### How to build a startup?\n\nYou can also use the checklist this [website](https://www.targetedwebtraffic.com/) to drive your ideas to\nstartups and start a business.\n"
