# &#xA;Everything you need to know about user experience (UX)



User experience (UX) is a very important concept that is
heard a lot in the world of technology and online businesses these
days. User Experience, or UX for short, is a popular field that is about
two decades old, and many people are looking to learn it. This field is
becoming more and more colorful day by day and in recent years many related
jobs have been created around the world, including Iran.

However, being familiar with this area, especially if you
work in startups and online businesses, can be very useful and even necessary
in some cases. In this article, we will tell you what user experience (UX)
is and how important it is.

## What is User Experience (UX)?

Every user will have experiences when using any application
or website. For example, when shopping from a store website, it may be
difficult for you to find a page out of the many pages on that site, or you may
be confused when shopping and the steps may seem complicated.

Another example is that you may enjoy working with an app
or, so to speak, figuring out what to do, but another app bothers you so much
that you immediately delete it from your phone and stop going to it.

These experiences will make you use a site or app many
times, or you will get tired of it in the first few seconds and give it a
try. In fact, a product (for example, a website) should be designed in
such a way that in addition to providing the user with ease of use, it also
experiences a good mood.

## Everything depends on the user experience

User Experience (UX), as its name implies, means the
experience, behavior, emotions and mentality that remain in the minds of your
users when using your products, services, site and application.

The user must find what he is looking for in the fastest
possible time on your site or application, and in other words, everything will
be in the most understandable and convenient way for him. In this case,
users will have a pleasant experience working with your
product; Otherwise, when they are confused and annoyed, they will not use
that product anymore. It is important to note that users today are looking
for the fastest and easiest ways to meet their needs.

## The importance of user experience

Regarding the importance of user experience, we must say
that when the user has a pleasant experience working with your site and
application, he becomes your regular customer. What could be better than
this? On the other hand, if the user encounters the complexity and
difficulty of accessing different parts of the site, he is more likely to leave
the site and not look back.

In addition, when the user likes your site, Google
algorithms also like your site. With this in mind, if you want to
succeed in optimizing and SEO your site, you must pay attention to the user
experience or UX of your site.

When you are user friendly, Google will also increase your
website in search results and show it to more people. All of this, in
simple terms, means gaining more audiences, retaining them, increasing sales of
products and services, and achieving any other goal you have in mind for your
business.

## What does the UX designer do?

By this part of the article, you understand what a user
experience is. So who does this? The answer is the UX
designer. The UX designer makes the experience of using the product and
service in all stages, from selection and purchase to its use, easy, desirable,
efficient and convenient for the user.

In fact, the work of a UX designer begins when there are no
products yet. The UX designer first identifies and evaluates customers and
their needs on the customer journey map.

When designing a site or application, the UX designer takes
into account all the activities that the user is supposed to do and provides
the easiest and most efficient way for each; In fact, with the right
guidance, the user tries to turn a confused user, who is entering your site or
application for the first time, into a wanderer.

He designs to get the best feedback and create a great user
experience with the site or app.

### What skills should a UX designer have?

The above definition was a simple definition of UX design
activities. User experience design work in practice requires a variety of
skills; A UX designer needs to know about sales and marketing, be familiar
with aesthetics and visual design, master copywriting, know content marketing,
have technical knowledge, even psychology, and be able to predict user
behavior. Be.

Of course, just because an UX designer has to figure out a
lot of things does not mean that he or she will be in charge. To create a
unique user experience, coordination between different units and the
cooperation of experienced and skilled marketing experts, graphics, design, content, content
marketing , etc. are essential.

### Features of an optimal user experience

Of course, designing a user experience for any product or
service varies from business to business, and should be unique, taking into
account the details of that business. In general, but the most important
factors affecting the user experience are:

The user should be able to easily use the product or service
you provide, and the user should be able to easily understand the design.

The user should be able to easily find something when he is
looking for it, otherwise he will ignore your product or service and go for
other options! simply! Information and things that the user needs to
be exposed to the user to find them quickly. If the user has a problem
using your site or application, they should be able to find a solution very
soon.

What you provide should meet the needs of the
audience. If the gap and needs of the user are not filled, why should he
use your product or service?

Your product or service should be user-friendly; This
means that it is aesthetically appealing and easy to use and
interpret. Make the user design as purposeful and minimal as possible.

Accessibility means that the design should be such that
everyone with any ability can use your product or service. For example,
you should consider that able-bodied people with mobility, hearing, vision, and
other impairments can also benefit from that product or service.

You may ignore this issue because of material issues and by
arguing that disabled people are a small part of society compared to healthy
people; But in this case, you have lost some of your audience, although
they may not be very large in front of other users. At the same time, you
have not fulfilled your social responsibility.

The customer will come back if they can trust you; But
if the first time he uses your product or service, he trusts you, he will
probably not give you a chance again and he will replace you with another
option. In designing the user experience, you should be able to gain the
user's trust for future referrals and uses.

needs of users, be aware of their tastes and behaviors, and have a thorough and
comprehensive research in general. With proper analysis and thorough

that the user follows and his possible actions on paper. This way you can
see what is going to happen from the beginning to the end and what experiences
are waiting for the user.

In user experience design, after the initial design, it is
the turn of the initial production. You have to produce what you have
designed in the initial version so that you can evaluate and test. In the
evaluation and testing phase, bugs and possible problems are found, and by
solving those problems, you get closer to the final version, which should have
the least problems.

## Production and publication of the final product

errors, and after simplifying the user experience, at this stage you can
publish the final product. Finally, you can take steps to improve your
product or service by receiving feedback.

interface (UI)

times; But do you know the difference between them? What is the
difference between user experience and user interface? The truth is that UI

time, the two can not be equated.

elements such as buttons and icons that a user uses to interact with a device
or application, site, or application. User experience is the feeling and
experience that the user gets when working with different parts of a business's
different products and services. In fact, the user experience is how the
user interacts with your interface.

In another definition, user experience is the user
interaction and experience with what we have provided by designing the visual
space as the user interface.

are necessary to each other and can not be separated. If you have an
attractive user interface but you cannot create a good experience of working
with your site or application for the user, he will not come to you
anymore. You need to be able to provide the best user interface and user
experience at the same time.
